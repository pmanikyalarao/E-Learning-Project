    <h2>Functions and Recursion in C</h2>
    <p>
        Functions are essential building blocks in C programming that allow you to encapsulate code for reuse, improve readability, and simplify debugging. Recursion is a powerful programming technique that enables a function to call itself, allowing for elegant solutions to complex problems.
    </p>

    <h3>Functions in C</h3>
    <p>
        A function in C is defined by its return type, name, and parameters. Functions can return values or perform actions without returning anything (void functions).
    </p>
    <h4>Function Syntax</h4>
    <pre><code>return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
    // Code to be executed
    return value; // Optional
}</code></pre>

    <h4>Example of a Function</h4>
    <pre><code>int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Advantages of Using Functions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Code Reusability: Write once, use multiple times.</li>
        <li>Modularity: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.</li>
        <li>Improved Readability: Makes the code easier to understand and maintain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recursion in C</h3>
    <p>
        Recursion occurs when a function calls itself to solve a problem. This technique is useful for tasks that can be defined in terms of smaller sub-tasks.
    </p>
    <h4>Example of a Recursive Function</h4>
    <pre><code>int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1; // Base case
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call
    }
}</code></pre>

    <h3>When to Use Recursion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When a problem can be broken down into smaller, similar problems.</li>
        <li>For tasks like traversing data structures (e.g., trees, graphs).</li>
        <li>When the solution can be expressed naturally in terms of itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding functions and recursion is crucial for effective C programming. This section will provide practical examples and exercises to help you master these concepts and apply them in your coding projects.
