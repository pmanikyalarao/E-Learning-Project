    <h2>Arrays in C</h2>
    <p>
        Arrays are a fundamental data structure in C that allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. They provide a convenient way to manage collections of related data and are widely used in programming.
    </p>

    <h3>What is an Array?</h3>
    <p>
        An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key. The elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it easy to access them using their indices.
    </p>

    <h3>Declaring and Initializing Arrays</h3>
    <p>
        You can declare an array by specifying its type and size. Arrays can be initialized at the time of declaration or assigned values later.
    </p>
    <pre><code>int arr[5]; // Declaration of an array of integers with 5 elements
int arr2[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Declaration and initialization</code></pre>

    <h3>Accessing Array Elements</h3>
    <p>
        Elements in an array are accessed using their index, which starts from 0. You can read or modify the values directly.
    </p>
    <pre><code>int first = arr2[0]; // Accessing the first element (1)
arr2[1] = 10; // Modifying the second element (now 10)</code></pre>

    <h3>Multidimensional Arrays</h3>
    <p>
        C also supports multidimensional arrays, such as two-dimensional arrays, which can be used to represent matrices or tables.
    </p>
    <pre><code>int matrix[3][3]; // Declaration of a 3x3 matrix
matrix[0][1] = 5; // Accessing the element in the first row, second column</code></pre>

    <h3>Common Uses of Arrays</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Storing collections of data (e.g., lists, matrices)</li>
        <li>Implementing algorithms that require batch processing of data</li>
        <li>Efficiently passing large amounts of data to functions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding arrays is crucial for effective programming in C. This section will provide practical examples and exercises to help you master the use of arrays in your coding projects.
