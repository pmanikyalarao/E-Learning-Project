    <h2>Structures in C</h2>
    <p>
        Structures in C are a user-defined data type that allow you to group different data types together under a single name. They are particularly useful for organizing complex data and creating custom data types that reflect real-world entities.
    </p>

    <h3>Defining a Structure</h3>
    <p>
        You can define a structure using the <code>struct</code> keyword followed by the structure name and its members enclosed in braces.
    </p>
    <pre><code>struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
};</code></pre>

    <h3>Declaring Structure Variables</h3>
    <p>
        After defining a structure, you can declare variables of that structure type.
    </p>
    <pre><code>struct Person person1, person2;</code></pre>

    <h3>Accessing Structure Members</h3>
    <p>
        You can access members of a structure using the dot operator (<code>.</code>).
    </p>
    <pre><code>person1.age = 30;
strcpy(person1.name, "Alice");
person1.height = 5.6;</code></pre>

    <h3>Initializing Structures</h3>
    <p>
        Structures can be initialized at the time of declaration.
    </p>
    <pre><code>struct Person person3 = {"Bob", 25, 5.9};</code></pre>

    <h3>Structures and Functions</h3>
    <p>
        You can pass structures to functions either by value or by reference (using pointers). Passing by reference is more efficient for large structures.
    </p>
    <pre><code>void printPerson(struct Person p) {
    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Height: %.2f\n", p.name, p.age, p.height);
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding structures is essential for organizing data in C programming. This section will provide practical examples and exercises to help you effectively use structures in your coding projects.
