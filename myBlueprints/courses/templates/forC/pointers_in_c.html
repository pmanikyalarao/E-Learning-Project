    <h2>Pointers in C</h2>
    <p>
        Pointers are a powerful feature in C programming that allow you to work directly with memory addresses. Understanding pointers is crucial for efficient memory management and for creating complex data structures like linked lists, trees, and more.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a Pointer?</h3>
    <p>
        A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers provide a way to directly access and manipulate memory, enabling more efficient and flexible programming.
    </p>

    <h3>Declaring Pointers</h3>
    <p>
        To declare a pointer, use the <code>*</code> operator before the pointer's name.
    </p>
    <pre><code>int *ptr; // Pointer to an integer</code></pre>

    <h3>Initializing Pointers</h3>
    <p>
        Pointers should be initialized before use. You can assign a pointer the address of a variable using the <code>&</code> operator.
    </p>
    <pre><code>int var = 10;
int *ptr = &var; // ptr now holds the address of var</code></pre>

    <h3>Accessing Values through Pointers</h3>
    <p>
        You can access the value stored at the address pointed to by a pointer using the <code>*</code> operator (dereferencing).
    </p>
    <pre><code>int value = *ptr; // value is now 10</code></pre>

    <h3>Pointer Arithmetic</h3>
    <p>
        Pointers support arithmetic operations, allowing you to navigate through arrays and other data structures.
    </p>
    <pre><code>int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
int *ptr = arr; // Points to the first element
int second = *(ptr + 1); // second is now 2</code></pre>

    <h3>Common Uses of Pointers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dynamic memory allocation</li>
        <li>Passing large structures or arrays to functions without copying</li>
        <li>Building complex data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Mastering pointers is essential for advanced C programming. This section will provide practical examples and exercises to help you understand and effectively use pointers in your coding projects.
