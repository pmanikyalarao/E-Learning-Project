    <h2>Loop Control Statements in C</h2>
    <p>
        Loop control statements in C allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly, based on a specified condition. They are essential for performing repetitive tasks efficiently and are a fundamental concept in programming.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Loop Control Statements</h3>
    
    <h4>1. For Loop</h4>
    <p>
        The <code>for</code> loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
    </p>
    <pre><code>for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to execute in each iteration
}</code></pre>

    <h4>2. While Loop</h4>
    <p>
        The <code>while</code> loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition being true. The code block is executed as long as the condition remains true.
    </p>
    <pre><code>while (condition) {
    // Code to execute in each iteration
}</code></pre>

    <h4>3. Do-While Loop</h4>
    <p>
        The <code>do-while</code> loop is similar to the <code>while</code> loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.
    </p>
    <pre><code>do {
    // Code to execute in each iteration
} while (condition);</code></pre>

    <h3>Loop Control Statements</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to the loops themselves, C provides control statements to manipulate the flow within loops.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>break:</strong> Terminates the loop immediately, skipping any remaining iterations.</li>
        <li><strong>continue:</strong> Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Mastering loop control statements is crucial for creating efficient and effective C programs. This section will provide practical examples and exercises to help you understand and implement loops in various scenarios.
