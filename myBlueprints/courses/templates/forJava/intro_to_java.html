    <h1>Introduction to Java</h1>
    <p>Java is a high-level, versatile, and widely-used programming language that is known for its portability across platforms. Developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s, Java allows developers to create applications that can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming, which allows for modular and reusable code.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform-Independent:</strong> Write once, run anywhere (WORA) capability enables Java programs to run on different platforms without modification.</li>
        <li><strong>Robust and Secure:</strong> Java provides strong memory management and a secure environment for developing applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich API:</strong> Java has a comprehensive set of libraries that facilitate development in various domains, including web, mobile, and enterprise applications.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why Learn Java?</h2>
    <p>Learning Java opens up numerous opportunities in the software development field. It is widely used in enterprise-level applications, Android app development, and server-side technologies. With a strong community support and abundant resources available, beginners can easily find help and guidance.</p>
