    <h1>Comments in Java</h1>
    <p>Comments are an essential part of any programming language, including Java. They allow developers to annotate their code, making it easier to understand and maintain. Comments are ignored by the Java compiler, which means they do not affect the program's execution.</p>

    <h2>Types of Comments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single-Line Comments:</strong> These comments start with two forward slashes (<code>//</code>) and extend to the end of the line. They are typically used for brief explanations or notes.</li>
        <pre><code>// This is a single-line comment
System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // Print greeting</code></pre>

        <li><strong>Multi-Line Comments:</strong> These comments begin with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>. They can span multiple lines and are useful for longer explanations or temporarily disabling code.</li>
        <pre><code>/*
This is a multi-line comment
It can span multiple lines
*/
System.out.println("Hello, World!");</code></pre>

        <li><strong>Documentation Comments:</strong> Also known as Javadoc comments, these comments start with <code>/**</code> and end with <code>*/</code>. They are used to generate external documentation and typically precede class or method definitions.</li>
        <pre><code>/**
 * This method prints a greeting message.
 */
public void greet() {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}</code></pre>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Use Comments?</h2>
    <p>Using comments effectively in your Java code has several benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves code readability and understanding for yourself and others.</li>
        <li>Facilitates easier maintenance and updates to the codebase.</li>
        <li>Helps document the purpose and functionality of classes and methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Comments</h2>
    <p>To make the most of comments in your Java code, consider the following best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be clear and concise; avoid unnecessary verbosity.</li>
        <li>Keep comments up-to-date with the code they describe.</li>
        <li>Use comments to explain the "why" rather than the "what" when the code is self-explanatory.</li>
    </ul>
