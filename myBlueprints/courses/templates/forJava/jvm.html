    <h1>Introduction to JVM</h1>
    <p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a crucial component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that enables Java programs to run on any device or operating system that has the JVM installed. By providing a runtime environment, the JVM abstracts the underlying hardware and software, allowing developers to write code that is platform-independent.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of JVM</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> JVM allows Java programs to be executed on any platform without modification, thanks to its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> The JVM includes an automatic garbage collection feature that helps manage memory efficiently, freeing developers from manual memory management tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> The JVM has built-in security features, such as class loaders and bytecode verification, that help protect against malicious code.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> JVM incorporates Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which translates bytecode into native machine code at runtime, enhancing performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Learn JVM?</h2>
    <p>Understanding the JVM is essential for any Java developer, as it provides insights into how Java applications are executed. By learning about the JVM, you will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve your ability to troubleshoot and optimize Java applications.</li>
        <li>Gain a deeper understanding of Java's memory management and garbage collection.</li>
        <li>Learn how to leverage JVM features for better application performance and security.</li>
    </ul>
