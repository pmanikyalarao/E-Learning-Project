
    <h2>Introduction to Python</h2>
    <p>Python is a popular, high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> and released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java.</p>

    <h3>Key Features of Python:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy to Learn and Use:</strong> Python has a simple syntax that makes it easy to learn, even for beginners.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpreted Language:</strong> Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Python runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Python is free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Large Standard Library:</strong> Python comes with a vast library of modules and packages, reducing the need to write code from scratch for many common tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Typing:</strong> Python automatically determines the data type of variables, so you don't need to declare it explicitly.</li>
        <li><strong>Vast Ecosystem and Libraries:</strong> With thousands of third-party libraries available, Python is suited for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and much more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Python Applications:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Frameworks like Django and Flask allow developers to build powerful web applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Science & Machine Learning:</strong> Python libraries like <code>NumPy</code>, <code>Pandas</code>, and <code>scikit-learn</code> make it the go-to language for data analysis and machine learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Python scripts can automate repetitive tasks, saving time for developers and users.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Libraries like <code>Pygame</code> are used for developing games.</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific Computing:</strong> Libraries such as <code>SciPy</code> and <code>Matplotlib</code> help in scientific computations and visualizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Python Syntax Basics:</h3>
    <h4>Variables and Data Types</h4>
    <pre><code># Example of variables
x = 5        # Integer
y = "Hello"  # String
z = 3.14     # Float

print(x)   # Output: 5
print(y)   # Output: Hello
print(z)   # Output: 3.14
    </code></pre>
