    <h2>Variables in Python</h2>
    <p>In Python, a variable is a named location used to store data in memory. Variables can hold different types of data, including numbers, strings, lists, and more.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Typing:</strong> Python is dynamically typed, meaning you donâ€™t need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. The type is determined at runtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Variable Naming Rules:</strong> Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores. They are case-sensitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (<code>=</code>). For example:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>age = 25
name = "Alice"</code></pre>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>Here are some examples of variable assignments:</p>
    <pre><code># Integer variable
count = 10

# Float variable
price = 19.99

# String variable
greeting = "Hello, World!"

# List variable
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</code></pre>

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable.</li>
        <li>Avoid using reserved keywords (e.g., <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>) as variable names.</li>
        <li>Keep variable names concise but meaningful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Understanding how to use variables is fundamental to programming in Python. They enable you to store and manipulate data effectively in your applications.</p>
